## What You'll Learn

This section guides you through the foundational knowledge required to effectively use Docling Graph:

1. **[Installation](installation/index.md)** - Set up your environment with dependencies and GPU support
2. **[Schema Definition](schema-definition/index.md)** - Create Pydantic templates that define extraction schemas and graph structures
3. **[Pipeline Configuration](pipeline-configuration/index.md)** - Configure backends, models, and processing modes
4. **[Extraction Process](extraction-process/index.md)** - Convert documents and extract structured data
5. **[Graph Management](graph-management/index.md)** - Export and visualize knowledge graphs
